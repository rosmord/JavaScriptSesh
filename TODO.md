# TODO

- Improve code structure (now, the main problem is the mammoth `renderMdcObjectInto` function of `jsesh.js`) ;
- externalize the fonts, and makes it easy to refer to them ;

- Either use an existing SVG drawing library or write one for our needs (putting SVG drawPath textual commands "manually" is not a good solution at all)
- Move to a modern Javascript infrastructure


- TODO : improve structure to embed everything nicely in a   minimal number of functions...
- TODO : fix what happens when elements which "don't want" to be resized
  appear in a 'v' element. For instance, it's the case of cartouches.
